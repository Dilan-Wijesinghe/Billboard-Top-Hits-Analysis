# Billboard-Top-Hits-Analysis

Data Analysis project of songs on the Billboard Top Charts. 

## Overview
What defines a hit song? Can we identify underlying factors that make hit songs the way that they are?
This project analyzes songs that made it onto the Billboards top 100 from 1970 - 2018.
It uses the Spotify API to search and find the songs, and retreive metrics like 'energy' and 'danceability'.'
It also collects metrics like the musical Key, Tempo, and Time Signature.

This project was created by Dilan Wijesinghe and Shaheriar Malik
